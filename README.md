## My Story

**8 years in one of Europe's top academies** (TSG 1899 Hoffenheim) and a call-up to the **German U16 National Team** taught me what elite performance looks like. The discipline, the pressure, the relentless pursuit of improvement - it becomes part of who you are.

At **Creighton University**, I was team captain for 3.5 years while earning a triple bachelor's degree and a Master's in Business Analytics with a 3.97 GPA. Our team made it to the **NCAA Final Four** - not because we had the best players, but because we implemented **data-driven decisions** before it was cool.

At my first data job, I inherited **nothing** - no data warehouse, no pipelines, no documentation. I built the entire analytics infrastructure from scratch:

- 📊 **8+ data sources** integrated through Fivetran
- 🏔️ **Snowflake data warehouse** with Bronze-Silver-Gold architecture
- 📈 **Tableau dashboards** serving product, marketing, and leadership
- 🔄 **Automated pipelines** that actually run without breaking

Now I'm bringing that same **build-from-nothing** mentality to every project.
